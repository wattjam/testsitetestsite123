Welcome! We're glad you're here. We know you have a lot going on, so we hope this step-by-step checklist will help you understand what you need to know and do to enroll in your benefits—so you can be on your way to enjoying your new career adventure with us.

* Check out our [benefits eligibility rules](eligibility-requirements.html) for employees and dependents.
* [Watch these quick videos that summarize your plan options](benefits-videos.html).
* Enroll in your health and welfare benefits within 31 days of your date of hire. If you don't enroll by your deadline, you'll receive default coverage, which is employee-only coverage in the:

	* $300 Deductible medical plan
	* Dental plan (Core option)
	* Vision plan (Core option)

Be sure to review the [benefits welcome guide](pdf/benefits-welcome-guide-2018.pdf) to ensure you've completed all of your enrollment actions.

* Consider enrolling in [PayPal's 401(k) Savings Plan](401k-savings-plan.html). It's a great way to save for your future. PayPal will match 100% of your contribution up to 4% of your compensation. Both employee and PayPal contributions are immediately 100% vested. You may enroll in the 401(k) plan on the Friday following your date of hire.
