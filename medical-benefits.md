There are various medical plan options available to you:

 * $300 Deductible
 * Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) with Health Savings Account (HSA)
 * HMOs (offered in some locations)

##### $300 Deductible

 *  The $300 Deductible option is a plan that uses a network of providers who have agreed to accept the UnitedHealthcare (UHC) payment schedule for covered services.
 *  You have flexibility to see any provider, anywhere—you decide whether to use in- or out-of-network providers, but you pay less when you use in-network providers.
 * If you use an out-of-network provider, you're responsible for any billed charges that exceed "customary and reasonable" charges.
 *   There is no charge for covered preventive care services—they’re covered at 100% by the plan.
 * Each covered person must meet his or her individual deductible, up to the combined family deductible. Then the plan’s coinsurance is applied.
 * Medical copays, deductibles and coinsurance apply to the out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM). Once you meet your OOPM, the plan pays 100% for covered services through the end of the year.
 * Pharmacy benefits are provided by [CVS/caremark](prescription-drug-benefits.html).
 * For more information or to find a provider, check out [welcometouhc.com/paypal](http://welcometouhc.com/paypal).

##### Consumer Directed Health Plan with Health Savings Account (CDHP with HSA)

 * The CDHP with HSA is a high-deductible health plan. That means that except for preventive exams, all care (including prescriptions) is subject to the deductible and coinsurance.
 * You have the option to make tax-free contributions to an HSA to pay for qualified medical expenses or save for future medical expenses. The company also makes an annual contribution to the HSA ($450 for individuals or $900 for family). [Learn more about the HSA][headingFour].
 * The deductible applies to all services except preventive care.
 * The entire family must accumulate to the family deductible before any individual reaches coinsurance.
 * This plan costs less out of your paycheck than the $300 Deductible plan.
 * Pharmacy benefits are provided by [CVS/caremark](prescription-drug-benefits.html).
 * Review the [FAQs for the CDHP with HSA](pdf/2018-CDHP-FAQ-active.pdf) option.
 * To learn more about the CDHP with HSA, [review the CDHP video](video-cdhp-2018.html).
 * Visit [welcometouhc.com/paypal](http://welcometouhc.com/paypal) for additional details on the CDHP with HSA, such as confirming network providers and using the Medical Plan Cost Estimator.

##### HMO plans *(available only in AZ, CA and UT)*

In a health maintenance organization (HMO), you and each covered dependent must choose a primary care physician (PCP) within the HMO network, who coordinates all of your care with providers within the HMO network.

* You pay copays only, no coinsurance.
* If you go outside the network, you do not have any coverage except in emergency situations.
* The following plans are available in these states:
	* [Arizona: Health Net HMO](https://www.healthnet.com/)
	* [California: Kaiser HMO](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/)
	* [Utah: SelectHealth HMO](http://selecthealth.org/Pages/new.aspx)
