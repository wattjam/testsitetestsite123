There are various medical plan options available to you:

 * $300 Deductible
 * Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) with Health Savings Account (HSA)
 * HMOs (offered in some locations)

##### $300 Deductible

 *  The $300 Deductible option is a plan that uses a network of providers who have agreed to accept the UnitedHealthcare (UHC) payment schedule for covered services.
 *  You have flexibility to see any provider, anywhere—you decide whether to use in- or out-of-network providers, but you pay less when you use in-network providers.
 * If you use an out-of-network provider, you're responsible for any billed charges that exceed "customary and reasonable" charges.
 *   There is no charge for covered preventive care services—they’re covered at 100% by the plan.
 * Each covered person must meet his or her individual deductible, up to the combined family deductible. Then the plan’s coinsurance is applied.
 * Medical copays, deductibles and coinsurance apply to the out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM). Once you meet your OOPM, the plan pays 100% for covered services through the end of the year.
 * Pharmacy benefits are provided by [CVS/caremark](prescription-drug-benefits.html).
 * For more information or to find a provider, check out [welcometouhc.com/paypal](http://welcometouhc.com/paypal).

##### Consumer Directed Health Plan with Health Savings Account (CDHP with HSA)

 * The CDHP with HSA is a high-deductible health plan. That means that except for preventive exams, all care (including prescriptions) is subject to the deductible and coinsurance.
 * You have the option to make tax-free contributions to an HSA to pay for qualified medical expenses or save for future medical expenses. The company also makes an annual contribution to the HSA ($450 for individuals or $900 for family). <a hre="#" style="background-color: #00ff00;">Learn more about the HSA</a>.
 * The deductible applies to all services except preventive care.
 * The entire family must accumulate to the family deductible before any individual reaches coinsurance.
 * This plan costs less out of your paycheck than the $300 Deductible plan.
 * Pharmacy benefits are provided by [CVS/caremark](prescription-drug-benefits.html).
 * Review the [FAQs for the CDHP with HSA](pdf/2018-CDHP-FAQ-active.pdf) option.
 * To learn more about the CDHP with HSA, [review the CDHP video](video-cdhp-2018.html).
 * Visit [welcometouhc.com/paypal](http://welcometouhc.com/paypal) for additional details on the CDHP with HSA, such as confirming network providers and using the Medical Plan Cost Estimator.

##### HMO plans *(available only in AZ, CA and UT)*

In a health maintenance organization (HMO), you and each covered dependent must choose a primary care physician (PCP) within the HMO network, who coordinates all of your care with providers within the HMO network.

* You pay copays only, no coinsurance.
* If you go outside the network, you do not have any coverage except in emergency situations.
* The following plans are available in these states:
	* [Arizona: Health Net HMO](https://www.healthnet.com/)
	* [California: Kaiser HMO](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/)
	* [Utah: SelectHealth HMO](http://selecthealth.org/Pages/new.aspx)

The PayPal medical plans offer comprehensive coverage and cover you at 100% for in-network preventive care. As you're deciding on the plan that's right for you, keep in mind these key considerations that can help you choose:

* Consider your options using the [Medical Plan Cost Estimator](medicostestimator18/index.htm). In just a few short clicks, you can see which plan is better for you financially, from what you’ll pay out of your paycheck to what you’ll pay when accessing care.
* How much health care did you use last year? How much do you think you'll need this year? Do you have a surgery planned? Having a baby? Think about your medical plan needs for the coming year.
* Did you meet your deductible last year? Or did you pay more for coverage you didn't use?
* If there's a deductible, you'll have to meet it before the plan pays benefits. How much does the plan pay versus how much you'll need to pay (your coinsurance), and how much could you have to pay in one year (out-of-pocket maximum)?
* Must you use network providers to receive benefits? Does the plan cover out-of-network providers?
* How much does the plan cost each pay period? See your [Employee Contributions](2018-employee-contributions.html).
