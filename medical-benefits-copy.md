          <p>There are various medical plan options available to you:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>$300 Deductible</li>
            <li>Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) with Health Savings Account (HSA)</li>
            <li>HMOs (offered in some locations)</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 id="deductible">$300 Deductible</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>The $300 Deductible option is a plan that uses a network of providers who have agreed to accept the UnitedHealthcare (UHC) payment schedule for covered services.</li>
            <li>You have flexibility to see any provider, anywhere—you decide whether to use in- or out-of-network providers, but you pay less when you use in-network providers.</li>
            <li>If you use an out-of-network provider, you're responsible for any billed charges that exceed "customary and reasonable" charges.</li>
            <li>There is no charge for covered preventive care services—they’re covered at 100% by the plan.</li>
            <li>Each covered person must meet his or her individual deductible, up to the combined family deductible. Then the plan’s coinsurance is applied.</li>
            <li>Medical copays, deductibles and coinsurance apply to the out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM). Once you meet your OOPM, the plan pays 100% for covered services through the end of the year.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy benefits are provided by <a href="prescription-drug-benefits.html">CVS/caremark</a>.</li>
            <li>For more information or to find a provider, check out <a href="http://welcometouhc.com/paypal">welcometouhc.com/paypal</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 id="consumer-directed-health-plan-with-health-savings-account-cdhp-with-hsa">Consumer Directed Health Plan with Health Savings Account (CDHP with HSA)</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>The CDHP with HSA is a high-deductible health plan. That means that except for preventive exams, all care (including prescriptions) is subject to the deductible and coinsurance.</li>
            <li>You have the option to make tax-free contributions to an HSA to pay for qualified medical expenses or save for future medical expenses. The company also makes an annual contribution to the HSA ($450 for individuals or $900 for family). [Learn more about the HSA][headingFour].</li>
            <li>The deductible applies to all services except preventive care.</li>
            <li>The entire family must accumulate to the family deductible before any individual reaches coinsurance.</li>
            <li>This plan costs less out of your paycheck than the $300 Deductible plan.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy benefits are provided by <a href="prescription-drug-benefits.html">CVS/caremark</a>.</li>

          <h5 id="hmo-plans-available-only-in-az-ca-and-ut">HMO plans <em>(available only in AZ, CA and UT)</em></h5>

          <p>In a health maintenance organization (HMO), you and each covered dependent must choose a primary care physician (PCP) within the HMO network, who coordinates all of your care with providers within the HMO network.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You pay copays only, no coinsurance.</li>
            <li>If you go outside the network, you do not have any coverage except in emergency situations.</li>
            <li>The following plans are available in these states:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.healthnet.com/">Arizona: Health Net HMO</a></li>
